# DrugPredictionML
This repository contains a machine learning-based analysis of drug prescription data. It includes classification models (Support Vector Machine, Na√Øve Bayes) to predict drug types based on patient attributes, a regression model (Linear Regression) to estimate sodium-to-potassium ratio, and a clustering approach (DBSCAN) for pattern discovery.
